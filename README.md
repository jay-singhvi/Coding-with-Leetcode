# Learning-to-code-with-Leetcode

Learning how to solve leetcode problems and preparing for interview questions

You can view the solution code directly by clicking on the link but I will always suggest that you first try to solve the problem on your own for atleast 20-30 mins only then looking at a solution.

This repository contains my solutions to leetcode problems. Here's a list of problems and solutions:
